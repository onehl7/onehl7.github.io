      Traffic classified 
      - Microsoft Traffic - all M365, Teams, MS SaaS etc
      - Internet Traffic 
      - Private Access for self-hosted apps
      - uses a lightweight filter (LWF) driver to acquire traffic, acquires traffic based on the traffic forwarding profiles you configure.
      - This distinction allows the GSA client to coexist with these other solutions
    - |
      Netskope Client inspects the end device packets using OS packet filtering capabilities (Traffic mode and exceptions)- process varies according to the OS and the presence of Explicit Proxy in the network.
      
      Client uses Forward Proxy Steering mechanism, creates an SSL tunnel from the end device and terminates it at the Netskope forward proxy in the Cloud. Tunnel carries traffic specified in steering configuration. 
      
      Netskope IP range must bypass any SSL decryption/inspection, All connections between the Netskope Client and Netskope cloud are Certificate-Pinned to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks, so attempting to inspect this connection will cause it to fail
    - |
      Zscaler Client Connector creates a virtual network adapter and uses  packet-filter based forwarding, The app uses OS routing to forward traffic via this interface to the Zscaler service.

  - - Policy
    - |
      SSE policies unified in Secure Access, but NAC/SD‑WAN/security posture live in other Cisco tools
    - |
      High policy unification for identity/device: CA and compliance apply across SaaS, private, and Internet, with GSA-specific traffic controls layered on.
      
      Security profile, policies are enforced according to logical ordering of unique priority numbers, with 100 being the highest priority and 65,000 being the lowest priority (similar to traditional firewall logic)
      
      Baseline security profile as a 'catch-all' policy without a Conditional Access policy.
      
      Link a security profile to a Conditional Access policy if required.
      
      Fileter network file content (preview) - DLP
    - |
      One policy framework for web, SaaS, private apps and data controls.
      
      Steering Profile - steers traffic what traffic it needs to capture and send towards Netskope, and what traffic it needs to bypass and let through directly.
      
      Netskope policies operate on the principle of first match, top-to-bottom.
    - |
      Strong, but SWG policies in ZIA and ZTNA policies in ZPA are handled in distinct views
  - - Admin experience
    - |
      SSE & SASE, Best if you already live in Cisco security/SD‑WAN consoles; more moving parts but good convergence story.
      
      If you are a Cisco-heavy network/security shop, Cisco Secure Access lets you align SSE policies with SD‑WAN, ISE, Duo, and existing Secure Client deployments, at the cost of working across more than one console for full SASE
    - |
      SSE focused, Best if you live in Entra/M365 already; almost everything is Entra policy-first with GSA as an extension.
      
      If you are very Microsoft-centric (Entra, Intune, Defender, M365), Microsoft GSA gives the cleanest identity and device posture integration, because the “console” is really Entra, and GSA policies are just specializations of the same Conditional Access model you likely already use.
    - |
      Very SSE-focused, less tied to any one ecosystem, but single place for security/web/data policy.
      
      Unified policies for web, SaaS, and private apps in one place, designed for “one platform, one client, one policy”.
    - |
      SSE and SASE, Mature SWG/ZTNA controls; admins think in terms of ZIA vs ZPA daily.
      
      Rich but more segmented policy constructs; admins commonly work across multiple consoles or modules for ZIA vs ZPA.

  - - DNS / synthetic IPs
    - |
      Domain-based flow redirection using random non-routable loopback synthetic IP
      
      KDF handles domain rule matching , synthetic IP to FQDN mapping and cache of records
    - |
      Private DNS service allows you to add domain suffixes for the organization,any DNS queries matching FQDN are sent to the DNS proxy at GSA edge, if cached, DNS proxy will return response , if not then DNS proxy forwards to Connector, which uses local DNS server to resolve and passes response back to GSA edge.GSA client then assigns a synthetic IP address, and returns it back to the application. The synthetic IP is used to steer the application traffic to GSA edges. On the client, an entry in the Name Resolution Policy Table (NRPT) is generated (synthetic IPs - 6.6.x.x)for the suffix to resolve via the GSA client.NSLOOKUP doesn't follow NRPT rules. To force queries with the tunnel, use nslookup fs.contoso.local 6.6.255.254.

      ZPA - client intercepts DNS requests , Zscaler Client Connector sends a synthetic IP in response to the DNS request or replies with NXDOMAIN

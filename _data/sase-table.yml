      Traffic classification:
      - Microsoft traffic (all M365, Teams, MS SaaS)
      - Internet traffic
      - Private Access for self‑hosted apps
    netskope: |
      Netskope Client inspects end‑device packets using OS packet filtering (traffic modes & exceptions vary by OS)

      Netskope IP ranges must bypass local SSL inspection; client‑cloud connections are certificate‑pinned to prevent MitM
    zscaler: |
      Zscaler Client Connector creates a virtual network adapter and uses packet‑filter based forwarding; apps use OS routing to forward traffic via this interface to the Zscaler service

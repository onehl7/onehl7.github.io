In the technology world, we often use **Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)** â€” 
a scale from 1 to 9 originally designed by NASA â€” to assess how mature a technology is, 
from the lab bench to full deployment.  

But where do **quantum technologies** fit on this spectrum?  
Thatâ€™s where **Quantum Technology Readiness Levels (QTRLs)** come in â€” 
an adapted framework that helps us measure how close we are to practical 
quantum computing, sensing, and communications.

## ðŸŒŒ What are QTRLs?
- **TRLs** were first developed by NASA to standardize how we evaluate 
  the readiness of aerospace technologies.  
- **QTRLs** are a specialized adaptation, used by quantum researchers and 
  policymakers to track the maturity of quantum systems such as 
  computers, sensors, and secure communication devices.  

Examples:  
- **QTRL-1** â†’ Theoretical principles (basic quantum algorithms or models).  
- **QTRL-2** â†’ Core device concepts and first lab demonstrations.

## âš¡ Current State of Quantum Tech
Most experts place todayâ€™s **quantum computers and devices** 
in the **QTRL 3â€“4 range**:  
- **Proof-of-concept in labs**.  
- Demonstrated on small systems, but not yet practical at scale.  

This era is often called the **NISQ Era** (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum).  
We have tens to hundreds of qubits, but theyâ€™re fragile, noisy, 
and far from fault-tolerant.

## ðŸš€ Roadmap Ahead
- **Optimistic projections**: Some roadmaps expect usable 
  quantum systems reaching **QTRL 8â€“9 by ~2030â€“2032**.  
- **Breakthroughs**:  
  - IBM and Google have announced progress toward error-corrected systems.  
  - Startups like **Oxford Quantum Circuits** are integrating 
    early quantum devices into data centres.

## âœ… Conclusion
QTRLs give us a structured way to think about progress.  
Right now, most quantum tech is still in the **early-middle stages**, 
but with massive global investment, the **quantum decade** ahead could 
bring the leap from research labs to real-world deployment.  

Stay tuned â€” in future posts, Iâ€™ll explore specific quantum use cases 
like secure communications, advanced sensing, and the role of AI in 
accelerating the quantum race.

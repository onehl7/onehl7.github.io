In the technology world, we often use **Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)**—a scale from 1 to 9 originally designed by NASA—to assess how mature a technology is, from the lab bench to full deployment.

But where do **quantum technologies** fit on this spectrum? That’s where **Quantum Technology Readiness Levels (QTRLs)** come in—an adapted framework that helps us measure how close we are to practical quantum computing, sensing, and communications.

## What are QTRLs?

TRLs were first developed by NASA to standardize how we evaluate the readiness of aerospace technologies. QTRLs are a specialized adaptation, used by quantum researchers and policymakers to track the maturity of quantum systems such as computers, sensors, and secure communication devices.

A few examples include:

*   **QTRL 1:** Theoretical principles (basic quantum algorithms or models).
*   **QTRL 2:** Core device concepts and first lab demonstrations.
*   **QTRL 4:** Multi-qubit systems are fabricated and tested.

## Current State of Quantum Tech

Most experts place today’s leading **quantum computers and devices** in the **QTRL 3–5 range**. This means we are largely in the experimental and validation phase.

### Key Takeaways:

*   **Proof-of-concept in labs:** We can build and control small-scale quantum systems.
*   **NISQ Era:** We are in the "Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum" era, where devices are powerful but still prone to errors.
*   **Error Correction is Key:** The next major leap to higher QTRLs will require robust quantum error correction, which is still an active area of research.

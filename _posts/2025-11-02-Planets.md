## Planetary rotational speeds and day lengths

Below is a compact reference for the eight major planets: their sidereal rotation period (how long the planet takes to rotate once relative to the stars), an easy-to-read length-of-day, and the approximate equatorial surface speed.

| Planet   | Sidereal rotation period | Length of (solar) day | Equatorial speed (approx.) |
|----------|---------------------------:|-----------------------:|----------------------------:|
| Mercury  | 58.65 Earth days (~1407.5 h) | ~58d 15h (sidereal)     | ~10.9 km/h (0.0030 km/s)    |
| Venus    | −243.0 Earth days (~5832.6 h, retrograde) | ~243d (retrograde) | ~6.5 km/h (0.0018 km/s)     |
| Earth    | 23.93 hours (sidereal)     | 24 h (solar day)       | ~1673 km/h (0.465 km/s)     |
| Mars     | 24.62 hours                | ~24 h 37 m             | ~861 km/h (0.239 km/s)      |
| Jupiter  | 9.93 hours                 | ~9 h 55 m              | ~44,300 km/h (12.3 km/s)    |
| Saturn   | 10.66 hours                | ~10 h 40 m             | ~34,330 km/h (9.54 km/s)    |
| Uranus   | 17.24 hours (axial tilt, retrograde-like) | ~17 h 14 m    | ~9,245 km/h (2.57 km/s)     |
| Neptune  | 16.11 hours                | ~16 h 7 m              | ~9,600 km/h (2.67 km/s)     |

Notes:
- Sidereal rotation is the best measure of how fast a planet spins; solar day can differ (e.g., Venus has a retrograde rotation).
- Speeds are approximate equatorial linear speeds computed from mean radii and rotation periods; values are rounded for clarity.

## Quick takeaways

- Slowest rotator: Venus — it has the slowest spin (and rotates retrograde), giving it the longest day (~243 Earth days).
- Fastest rotator: Jupiter — completes a rotation in under 10 hours, yielding the highest equatorial speed (~12 km/s).
- Earth: a convenient 24-hour solar day (sidereal ~23.93 h); equatorial speed ≈ 1,673 km/h.
- Oddities: Uranus rotates on its side (large axial tilt), which makes its seasonal and day/night behavior unusual; Venus and Uranus have retrograde or retrograde-like rotation relative to most planets.
